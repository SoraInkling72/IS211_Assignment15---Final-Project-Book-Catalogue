# IS211_Assignment15---Final-Project-Book-Catalogue

This is my final project submission, being a book catalogue.

This is the project description: A web application that helps a user record details about the books they own. The application allows a user to login and type in an ISBN, which will instigate a search using the Google Books API. The server will save some of the information to a JSON database, which will be used to show the user their list of books.
